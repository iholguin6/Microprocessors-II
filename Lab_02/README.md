# _Lab 2 GPIO, Interrupts, and Queues_

## Goal
Given the program template in Listing 1, create a program which uses port interrupts to trigger a task.
• The port interrupts must be connected to external push buttons which will trigger the “print_task”.
• On the “print_task” your program should print that the interrupt was trigger.
## Bonus
Modify the code so the “print_task” prints what port caused the 
interrupt.
